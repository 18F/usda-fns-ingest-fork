# usda-fns-ingestor

An experiment in ingesting data for the USDA's Food and Nutrition Service
using [ReVAL](https://github.com/18F/ReVAL).

Use [the webform](https://usda-fns-ingestor.app.cloud.gov/data_ingest/api/validate/)
to interactively upload files and see
validation results, or the [API](api.md) to simply see the validation results.

## Development

To start development, clone this repository:

	git clone https://github.com/18F/usda-fns-ingest.git

<!-- You will need to install [Python 3.6](http://www.python.org/)

Install development dependencies using [Pipenv](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/):

	pipenv install --dev -->

<!-- should confirm we still need this step, we may not -->
Copy `.env_sample` to `.env` and update the variables according to cloud.gov `env`.

In your terminal run:
```
Docker compose up
```
While that is running in a new tab run the migrations
```
docker exec -it usda-fns-ingest-usdafnsingest-1 /bin/bash
# python manage.py migrate

```
<!-- to do: improve installs so that you can just run the tests -->
Run the tests wih:
```
# pip install parameterized
# python manage.py tests
```


This tool makes use of the [ReVAL](https://github.com/18F/ReVAL) tool, if you also are developing that tool at the same time, you will need to have a local copy of it.  You can then install and point to the local copy so the changes you make there will reflect on this tool immediately.

	pipenv install -d -e <path to ReVAL>


<!-- You can then activate the Python virtual environment:

	pipenv shell -->

<!-- ## Deploying locally

You'll need to install [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), then

    createdb usda_fns_ingestor
    cd usda_fns_ingestor
    python manage.py runserver

You can use other PostgreSQL configurations (database name, user,
require a password, etc); just `export DATABASE_URL=<database url>`.
See [dj-database-url](https://github.com/kennethreitz/dj-database-url) -->

Then you can access the system at
[http://localhost:8000/data_ingest/](http://localhost:8000/data_ingest/)

## Deploying to cloud.gov

Once [logged into a cloud.gov workspace](https://cloud.gov/docs/apps/deployment/),
you can

    cd usda_fns_ingestor
    cf create-service aws-rds shared-psql usda-fns-ingestor-db
    cf push

Other CloudFoundry platforms and Heroku should work similarly,
though different plans may be available (see `cf marketplace`)
